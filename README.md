## Development
open mongo compas to db interactive

Update your local database connection in `application.properties` or create your own `application-local.properties` file to override
settings for development.

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be
added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".



After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.
API docs at: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/goodbook-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If required, a Docker image can be created with the Spring Boot plugin. Add `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` as
environment variable when running the container.

```
mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=com.soa/goodbook
```
